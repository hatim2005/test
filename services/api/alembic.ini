# Alembic Database Migration Configuration
# This configuration file is used by Alembic to manage database schema migrations
# for the Color Correction System API.

# Path to migration scripts
script_location = alembic

# Template used to generate migration files
file_template = %%(year)d_%%(month).2d_%%(day).2d_%%(hour).2d%%(minute).2d-%%(rev)s_%%(slug)s

# Prepend sys.path with the current directory if needed
prepend_sys_path = .

# Timezone to use for migrations
timezone = UTC

# Set truncate_slug_length to control the length of the slug
truncate_slug_length = 40

# Set this to use revision environment instead of the database
# sqlalchemy.url = driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname

# Use the database URL from environment variable
# sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://user:password@localhost/color_correction
# For SQLite (development):
# sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///./color_correction.db

# NOTE: The database URL is configured in env.py to read from environment variables
# This allows different configurations for development, testing, and production

# Uncomment below to use black formatter on migration files
